Mundane Photoshop things to simplify various little tasks.

Currently there are 3 little scripts and currently all they do is downscale by a factor 2, 3 or 4.
Put the scripts in your /Presets/Scripts folder wherever you have Photoshop installed (and restart the program if it's running) and they'll appear under scripts next time you start it.

The idea is the further down the road add luminance denoising through the ACR (Adobe Camera Raw) plugin, which for the record is pretty amazing, but I haven't gotten that to work quite yet.
